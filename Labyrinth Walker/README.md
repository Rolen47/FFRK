This Autohotkey script goes through the Labyrinth dungeons in Final Fantasy Record Keeper semi-automatically. It will play an alarm whenever a Treasure Room is entered so you can choose which chests to open.

Requirements:
Autohotkey installed on your PC
Your favorite Android emulator (I used Nox)
Your FFRK settings must be set to "Simplified Display" or else the animations will cause Autohotkey's ImageSearch to fail.

To get this script to work you need to replace the snips in the "images" folder with your own. Take screenshots with Windows Snipping Tool while going through the dungeon manually. After all the images have been replaced with your own press F1 to unpuase/pause the script. You can press F2 to panic close the script.

If you want to make your own changes to the script open FFRK Labyrinth.ahk with notepad. Remember to exit and reload the script after saving changes. You can change the priority the paintings by simply changing the number in "Priority#" variables inside the script with notepad.
